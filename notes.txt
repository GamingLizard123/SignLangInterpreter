GOALS:
-- Create a database where your hand signs are stored
-- Create algorithm that will compare the hashes to your database
-- Make threading in your project 1 for front end camera 1 for algorithm


Notes:
--the data is always fed only one hand at a time
--there are 842 points of data in the positional data in the algorithm
    -> 840 relativity points for achoring
    -> 2 points for handedness
